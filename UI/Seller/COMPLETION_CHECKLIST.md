## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well âœ…
1. **Batch Processing**: Fixing multiple files with similar patterns simultaneously
2. **Automated Testing**: Playwright caught issues early and validated changes
3. **Systematic Approach**: Following phases 1-6 ensured nothing was missed
4. **Documentation Templates**: Reusable documentation structure

### Challenges Overcome âœ…
1. **Folder Names with Spaces**: Handled via URL encoding
2. **Typo in Dashboard Folder**: Preserved for consistency
3. **Depth-2 Structure**: Applied consistent relative path formula
4. **Test URL Encoding**: Fixed regex patterns to handle encoded spaces

### Recommendations for Next Folder
1. Start with file discovery and mapping
2. Use batch processing for similar files
3. Create tests early to validate changes
4. Keep documentation consistent with this folder's structure
5. Manual verification is still important despite automated tests
