    - **Reason: Not Applicable** - This is a modal/popup view without sidebar navigation

## Changes Applied:

### 1. Logo/Brand Link (All Files)
Wrapped the logo/brand section with dashboard link:
```html
<a href="../../stitch_seller_dashborad/dashborad.html" class="p-6">
  <h1>Inflopick</h1>
  <p>Seller Hub</p>
</a>
```

### 2. Navigation Links (All Files)
Replaced all `href="#"` with proper relative paths:

- **Dashboard** → `../../stitch_seller_dashborad/dashborad.html`
- **Orders** → `../../stitch_seller_orders/orders/orders.html`
- **Products** → `../../stitch_seller_products/product overview/product overview.html`
- **Marketing** → `../../stitch_seller_marketing/marketing overview/marketing overview.html`
- **Customer** → `../../stitch_seller_customer/customer records/customer records.html`
- **Chat** → `../../stitch_seller_chatbox/seller chatbox/seller chatbox.html`
- **Analytics** → `../../stitch_seller_analytics (missing detail pages)/analytics overview/analytics overview.html`
- **Storefront Preview** → `../../stitch_seller_storefront/seller storefront/seller storefront.html`
- **Accounts Management** → `../../stitch_seller_account_management/account management/account management.html`
- **Logout** → `#` (unchanged - no actual logout page)

### 3. Active State Preservation
Each file maintains its active navigation state:
- Account Management files: "Accounts Management" stays active (bg-primary/text-white)
- Order detail files: "Orders" stays active
- Marketing files: "Marketing" stays active
- Customer files: "Customer" stays active
- Product files: "Products" stays active

The logo/brand area is clickable and returns to dashboard.
Active navigation states are preserved for the current section.
