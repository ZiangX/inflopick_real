## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** web (Web Application - multi-sided marketplace)
- **Project Level:** 4 (Enterprise scale - multiple products/systems)
- **Instruction Set:** Level 4 - Full PRD + Epics + Architecture + JIT Tech Specs
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Inflopick - Canadian commerce hub connecting creators, merchants, and buyers through creator-led storefronts and affiliate product links. Multi-role platform with complex integrations (Stripe, Shopify, carriers).
- **Estimated Stories:** 40+ stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 9 epics (from existing user-stories.md)
- **Timeline:** 12-month delivery to profitability

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** Comprehensive (project-brief.md, prd.md with 52 FRs, user-stories.md with 9 epics)
- **Team Size:** TBD
- **Deployment Intent:** Production SaaS platform (Canada-first launch)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 2 (Planning):**
- Enhanced/validated PRD.md
- epics.md (breakdown from user-stories.md)
- ux-specification.md (4 role interfaces: Creator, Merchant, Buyer, Admin)

**Phase 3 (Solutioning - Required for Level 4):**
- solution-architecture.md (overall system design)
- tech-spec-epic-X.md (generated JIT per epic during Phase 4)

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**
- story-X.Y.md files (one per story, sequentially drafted)
- story-context-X.Y.xml (context for each story)
- Completed implementation per DoD

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 2: Planning** (Starting now)
   - Run `plan-project` workflow
   - Validate existing PRD, generate epics breakdown
   - Run `ux-spec` workflow for UI/UX specifications

2. **Phase 3: Solutioning** (After Phase 2 complete)
   - Run `solution-architecture` workflow
   - Design overall architecture, data model, integrations
   - Tech specs generated JIT during Phase 4 per epic

3. **Phase 4: Implementation** (After Phase 3 complete)
   - SM agent drafts stories sequentially from backlog
   - DEV agent implements approved stories
   - Iterative story-by-story delivery

### Next Actions

**Immediate:** Run `plan-project` workflow with PM agent

**After plan-project:** Run `ux-spec` workflow for UI design

**After Phase 2:** Run `solution-architecture` workflow

## Special Considerations

**UI Components Required:** Yes - 4 distinct role interfaces (Creator storefront & dashboard, Merchant admin panel, Buyer marketplace, Platform admin)

**Complex Integrations:** Stripe Checkout + Connect, Shopify URL import, carrier tracking APIs, KYC provider

**Multi-Tenancy:** Creator storefronts, Merchant storefronts, platform-wide search and recommendations

**Compliance:** KYC/AML, Canadian financial regulations, 7-year transaction retention

## Technical Preferences Captured

**Stack:** TBD (to be defined during solution-architecture)

**Integrations Confirmed:**
- Payments: Stripe Checkout + Stripe Connect
- Catalog Import: Shopify product URL import (AI-assisted)
- Carriers: Canada Post, UPS, DHL, FedEx, Intelcom
- Future: BAIeBill, BAIeShip, NexPay, NexShip

**Hosting:** Canada-based (compliance requirement)

**Currency:** CAD

**Languages:** English (launch), French (roadmap)

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 4 (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `D:\Old_Desktop\Projects\inflopick_real\docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md (9 epics from user-stories.md)

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-15**: Project classified as Level 4 (enterprise-scale multi-sided marketplace)
- **2025-10-15**: Greenfield web application targeting Canada market
- **2025-10-15**: Phase 1 (Analysis) marked complete - comprehensive documentation already exists
- **2025-10-15**: Phase 2 (Planning) complete - validated PRD and generated epics.md (9 epics, 39 stories)
- **2025-10-15**: Phase 3 (Solutioning) required due to Level 4 complexity
- **2025-10-15**: UX workflow recommended next - 4 distinct role interfaces needed (Creator, Merchant, Buyer, Admin)
